I am a first-year master student majoring in finance at School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University. I will join [Citi](https://www.citibank.com.cn/sim/english/index.htm) as a trading summer analyst in 2021 summer. 

I am somewhat a combination of a financial economics researcher and a data analyst with the weight from zero to one depending on the project settings. I am especially interested in building strategies and construct factors to achieve better financial performance. Specifically, I instill financial and statistical theories into machine learning models and optimize parameters using multiple data-driven methods, achieving a great balance between returns and risks.

Prior to my graduate career, I studied economics and finance with a minor in computer science at Tsinghua University. I also studied at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania as an exchange student in 2018 Fall.
