## Music
I love singing and listening to music. In 2017, I ranked 6<sup>th</sup> in Tencent National Singing Contest. So far, [My coverings](http://kg.qq.com/node/personal?uid=6b9c9887232937) have attracted more than 36 thousand followers in WeSing. Furthermore, I also sang original songs - e.g. [the theme song for 2020 Tsinghua Graduation Ceremony]( https://b23.tv/cWzDVR) - and performed at the Campus Singer Competition in Tsinghua University.

Besides, I’ve been a fan of Charlie Shen Zhou for many years. Here’s the photo I took when I was at his vocal concert.

## POP MART collection
I enjoy collecting POP MART toys! As portfolio managers maintain a wide variety of assets, I manage a portfolio of POP MART toys though I do not sell them.
My current investment strategy lies in the intersection of beauty and Harry Potter/ Disney Princes. Specifically, I am interested in collecting pretty POP MART toys in Harry Potter series and Disney movies (obviously “Fluffy” has nothing to do with “pretty”).

Currently I have obtained more than twenty POP MART toys, some of which are gifts from my friends. I put them on my desk with my computer, with a hope that they can learn to optimize their appearance and placements using algorithms by themselves.

I am always looking for ~~profitable~~ pretty POP MART toys. If you find some, please let me know. I will seriously consider ~~investing~~ buying them.
