## Selected Research Projects
1. Bond Yield Spread Pricing using Machine Learning, Research assistant in Tsinghua University, 2019.
- Constructed X factors (momentum, liquidity, lag etc.,) using ARMA models, and Y (excess return) using Cubic Spline interpolation.
- Built prediction models using panel regression and Lasso regression separately on Python. Achieved 86% precision within Â±2.5bps.

2. Quantitative Stock Selection Strategy Research, Research assistant in Standford University, 2019.
- Carried out in-depth research on pair-trading strategy based on GARCH model by expanding the theory to multiple stocks using generalized co-integration theory.
- Achieved 31% APR and 2.33 Sharpe ratio in the US stock market after parameter optimization.

## Selected Contests
1. Kaggle-TMDB box-office prediction contest, Member of a Silver Medal Group, 2019.
- Carried out normalization and one-hot encoding on features, PCA reduction on string variables, and feature constructions on inputs.
- Built different models using algorithms of SVM (support vector machine), regression tree, boosting (including XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost and AdaBoost). Did hyper-parameter optimization using Random Grid Search and 5-fold cross validation.
